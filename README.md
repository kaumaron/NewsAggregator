# The News Unspun's News Aggregator

## Gist

The aggregator takes a list of RSS feeds and uses keywords from the feed's article titles and descriptions to create a dendrogram of similar articles. This should be a working version **however, I just added in security for the keys, passwords, etc**. I was not able to test it due to the AWS EC2 instance being too small and my goal was to shut it down.
